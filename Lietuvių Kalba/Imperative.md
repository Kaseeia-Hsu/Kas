#Lithuanian #declension 

For Lithuanian, when we want to use imperative, it's rather simple to form it, and the rule is:
we have genitive verb ending with __"-ti"__, we just take it away and put __"-k"__ to replace it.

kalbė-ti -> kalbėk/-kite (Jūs)
ei-ti -> eik/-kite (Jūs)/__-kite (let's go)__
susto-ti -> sustok/-kite (Jūs)
