I endure life.

It's not pessimism nor defeatism--but a declaration of one mortal's total victory of his free will, an attempt of reaching immortality. I lost my fear of death, and subjugated both life and death by taking everyday of my life as my last day. I lost all mortal concerns and worries by believing in death in the next day. I freed myself, by committing suicide spiritually when the day finally ends: I hang myself, I drown myself, I shot myself, I crash myself, I bleed myself, I fall, and fall, and fall until the utmost kernel of life itself has been erased from my mind. Then, at this point, for what a normal person could still feel troublesome or dreadful, when "life" itself has been outcasted from one's universe? Nothing. Therefore, I became Moirai, the holy deities of trinity who control life and death--I became Fate itself. What should I afraid of? Why should I be afraid? Nothing. Nothing.
