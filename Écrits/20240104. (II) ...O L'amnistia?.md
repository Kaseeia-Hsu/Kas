_"The example of a syllogism he had studied in Kiesewetter's logic--Caius is a man, men are mortal, therefore Caius is mortal-had seemed to him all his life to be correct only in relation to Caius, but by no meanS to himself. For the man Caius, man in general, it was perfectly correct; but he was not Caius and not man in general..."_ 
	\- _Death of Ivan Ilyich,_ Dostoyevsky, Chapter VI

People spend their precious lives searching the essence of life. They falsely believe that they're on the seat of a divine, and omniscient Other in life, where they could overlook this inferno, and possess the holy duty of judging one's fate--_sulla condanna a morte... o l'amnistia._ _(on the sentence of death... or amnesty.)_ However, what people don't know is: life is not a court, but a huge execution ground. Thus, one could not refuse to be neither the gun, nor who's being pointed with the gun--sinner or murderer. Unfortunately, this earth is not a fairyland, but a struggle of survive, perfectly natural, and therefore extremely harsh.
