Taking my own body
Diving into your dream
Steping with my own feet
Writing of the trace of your fondness

the dim heart of you
is the tie never resolved between us
I'm about to go
and there's nothing else to say

In the darkest epoch
I can only find those whose names are lost
I think of
in that moment
they acted in silence
taking weapons, broke into my place
The whole state started burning

Even if there are thousands way for me to live
I still cannot stop this inhumane evil
