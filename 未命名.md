當我死時，葬我，在[長江](https://baike.baidu.hk/item/%E9%95%B7%E6%B1%9F)與[黃河](https://baike.baidu.hk/item/%E9%BB%83%E6%B2%B3)之間
Bury me between Yangtze and the Yellow River when I die.
枕我的頭顱，白髮蓋着黑土
Put a pillow under my cranium, and cover my white hair with black dirt.
在中國，最美最母親的國度
In China--where's the most magnificent and maternal land to me
我便坦然睡去，睡整張大陸
I can rest in peace, rest on the whole continent.
聽兩側，安魂曲起自長江，黃河
And listen to the requiems that stemed from Yangtze an the Yellow River
兩管永生的音樂，滔滔，朝東
Two streams of eternal music will flow, flow towards the east.
這是最縱容最寬闊的牀
This is the wildest, and widest bed.
讓一顆心滿足地睡去，滿足地想
Which could satisfy, and pacify a sould into its dream.
從前，一箇中國的青年曾經
Once upon a time, a youth who had been sticked with China for his whole life
在冰凍的密西根向西瞭望
gazed afar to the west, from fronzen Michigan
想望透黑夜看中國的黎明
he wanted to penetrate the night, all the way to see the dawn of China
用十七年未饜中國的眼睛
he wants to use his eyes, which have left China for seventeen years
[饕餮](https://baike.baidu.hk/item/%E9%A5%95%E9%A4%AE)地圖，從[西湖](https://baike.baidu.hk/item/%E8%A5%BF%E6%B9%96)到[太湖](https://baike.baidu.hk/item/%E5%A4%AA%E6%B9%96)
To devour the map, all the way from West lake to Taihu lake
到多鷓鴣的重慶，代替回鄉
and to Chongching, wheres abundant in partridges, only to fulfill the dream of returning home
